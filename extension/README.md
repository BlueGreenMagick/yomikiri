Currently only working for chrome.

### Development
1. Run `yarn dev`
2. Add `build/` directory as extension. ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked))


### Structure
'assets' directory stores assets that are 'imported' by code.
'res' folder stores resources that has to be copied into build.
